The purpose of this project is to take the sound file input by the user (mp3, or .wav)
and first make sure the file is wav, or convert the mp3 to wav. After doing so
the code strips metadata and strips off any extra channels to make sure the code
is working with a mono-channel sound file.

Once this is complete the program extracts and calculates and displays critical data and plots the
waveform, spectrogram, fft, and high, low, and medium frequencies.

The graphs are displayed in independent tabs, and the key data is displayed to the textbox.
